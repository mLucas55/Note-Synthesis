Review this list of categories from individual notes. Merge similar/overlapping categories into a clean taxonomy.

Rules:
- Combine near-duplicates (e.g., "Movies to Watch" + "Films to See" → "Movies to Watch")
- Keep categories at a consistent level of specificity
- Prefer the most common/natural phrasing when merging
- Maximum of 20-30 final categories (adjust based on your needs)

Output format: Return ONLY a JSON array of category strings:
["Category 1", "Category 2", "Category 3"]
